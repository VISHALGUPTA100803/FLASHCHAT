In this app i have incorporated Firebase into my Flutter app.  using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip my app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

I have used
1- Firebase
2- Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
3- beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
4- custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller.
5- mixins.
6- Streams
7- ListViews to build scrolling views.
8- Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly.
